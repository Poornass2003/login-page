A login form is one of the most important pages of a website that allows authorized users to access an entire site or a part of a website.
The login/sign-up page is the first page to show the users for login-protected sites. Whether itâ€™s a signup or login page, 
it should be attractive, user-friendly, and easy to use.

Overall, creating a Pure CSS Simple Login Page can simplify your web development process, reduce load times, improve accessibility, and make your website or application easier to maintain in the long run.
