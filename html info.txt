Step 1 (HTML Code):

To get started, we will first need to create a basic HTML file. In this file, we will include the main structure for our login form.


After creating the files just paste the following codes into your file. Make sure to save your HTML document with a .html extension, so that it can be properly viewed in a web browser.

Document Type and HTML Declaration

<!DOCTYPE html>: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used. Here, it indicates HTML5.
<html lang="en">: This tag encloses the entire HTML document and specifies the language as English.
Head Section

<head>: Contains meta-information about the HTML document.

<title>Home</title>: Sets the title of the webpage, which appears on the browser tab.
<meta charset="UTF-8" />: Specifies the character encoding for the document as UTF-8, supporting most characters and symbols.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />: Ensures the webpage is responsive by setting the viewport to the device's width.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />: Links an external CSS file named "styles.css" to style the HTML document.
Body Section


<body>: Contains the content of the HTML document displayed to the user.

<div class="container">: A container div that may be used for overall styling and layout.
<div class="center">: A centered div is used for centering the login form on the page.
<h1>Login</h1>: A header for the login form.
<form action="" method="POST">: A form element with POST method, used for sending form data to the server. The action attribute is empty, indicating that the form will submit to the same URL.
<div class="txt_field">: A div for a text input field.
<input type="text" name="text" required>: A required text input field for the username.
<span></span>: An empty span element, used for styling or validation messages.
<label>Username</label>: A label for the username input field.
<div class="txt_field">: A div for a password input field.
<input type="password" name="password" required>: A required password input field.
<span></span>: An empty span element, used for styling or validation messages.
<label>Password</label>: A label for the password input field.
<div class="pass">Forget Password?</div>: A div for a "Forget Password?" link or message.
<input name="submit" type="Submit" value="Login">: A submit button for the form.
<div class="signup_link">: A div for a signup link.
Not a Member? <a href="signup.php">Signup</a>: A message with a link to the signup page (signup.php).
This is the basic structure of our login form using HTML, and now we can move on to styling it using CSS.
