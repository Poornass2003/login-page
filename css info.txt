Next, we will create our CSS file. In this file, we will use some basic CSS rules to create our login form. We will also add some padding and margin properties to ensure that everything looks correct.

This will give our login form an upgraded presentation. Create a CSS file with the name of styles.css and paste the given codes into your CSS file. Remember that you must create a file with the .css extension.
